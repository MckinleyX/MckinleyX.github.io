	</p>
	

	<h3><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus">Alcumus</a> on AoPS</h3>
	<p>

	<p>
		An excellent, beginner-friendly introduction to four methods of proof (direct, contradiction, contrapositive, and induction) together with examples and great practice problems. This is blocked by FISD, if you're having trouble I have a mirror of it <a href="files/mop.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="files/induction.html">Introduction to Induction</a> 
		by me</h3>
	<p>
		My handout on mathematical induction
	</p>

		<p>A video series on calculus with the goal that you come away feeling like you've invented calculus yourself, with lots of visuals and intuition about <i>why</i> things are the way they are.
		</p>

	<h3> <a href="https://youtu.be/T647CGsuOVU">Complex Numbers are Real</a> by Welch Labs</h3>
		<p>
		A series of short (mostly ~5 minute) videos explaining complex (also known as lateral) numbers, intuitively. (The videos starting around the 8th/9th ones are above and beyond the curriculum.)
