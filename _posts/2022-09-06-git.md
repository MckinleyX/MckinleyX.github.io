I've set up a git server!

<!--more-->

It uses [soft-serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve).

You can access it through `ssh` by running 
```
ssh git.mckinleyxie.com 
``` 
but it also behaves nicely in general, so you can also do things like
```
git clone ssh://git.mckinleyxie.com/$REPO
``` 
where
`$REPO` is some repository.

Right now, though, it's running (slightly jankily) as a 
systemd service on port 23231, with 
`iptables` forwarding port 22 to port 23231 as suggested
by [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1762807) StackOverflow
answer, as the `AmbientCapabilities` systemd service option was not
cooperating.

So hopefully at some point in the near future I can figure out how 
Docker works since that seems like the proper way to run a 
thing.
