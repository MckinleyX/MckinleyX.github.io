	<h3><a href="http://hpmor.com">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality </a></h3>
	<p>
	"Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a Harry Potter rational fanfic by Eliezer Yudkowsky, AI researcher and decision theorist... This is an Alternate Universe story, where Petunia married a scientist. Now Rationalist!Harry enters the wizarding world armed with Enlightenment ideals and the experimental spirit." - <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">Less Wrong</a>
	Even if you don't normally read fanfiction, give this a try. It's great. I stayed up until like 6 to finish it.
