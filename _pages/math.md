Here are links to some stuff! Hopefully they'll be helpful. 

## General 
### Glossary by me

A glossary of common math symbols

## Counting

### [Basic Counting Techniques](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amclearningprogram/amclearningprogram.github.io/main/handout/combinatorics/ALP_Basic_Counting_Techniques.pdf) by bissue 
### [More Counting](https://amclearningprogram.github.io/handout/combinatorics/ALP_More_Counting.pdf) by Kevin Min
Handouts made by ALP (the AMC Learning Program) that does a better job than I do.


### [Alcumus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus) on AoPS
Alcumus is a way to practice problems!

## Proofs 
### [methods of proof](https://how-did-i-get-here.com/59/) by hdigh
An excellent, beginner-friendly introduction to four methods of proof (direct, contradiction, contrapositive, and induction) together with examples and great practice problems. This is blocked by FISD, if you're having trouble I have a mirror of it <a href="assets/mop.html">here</a>.

### Introduction to Induction by me
My handout on mathematical induction

## Calculus 
### [The Essence of Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3Blue1Brown
A video series on calculus with the goal that you come away feeling like you've invented calculus yourself, with lots of visuals and intuition about <i>why</i> things are the way they are.


### [Complex Numbers are Real](https://youtu.be/T647CGsuOVU) by Welch Labs
A series of short (mostly ~5 minute) videos explaining complex (also known as lateral) numbers, intuitively. (The videos starting around the 8th/9th ones are above and beyond the curriculum.)
